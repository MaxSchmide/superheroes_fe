# Superheroes Library

This is the front-end part of the project, responsible for the user interface (UI) and interactions with the back-end server.

## Project Overview

This front-end project is built using React and leverages several key libraries and tools to enhance development:

- **Bootstrap**: Bootstrap is used for rapidly prototyping and styling the UI components, providing a responsive and visually appealing design.

- **Redux Toolkit**: Redux Toolkit is utilized for state management, including asynchronous actions for interacting with the back-end server. It simplifies the Redux setup and allows for efficient state updates.

- **React Router DOM**: This library is used for handling routing within the application, enabling navigation between different views or pages.

- **Swiper**: Swiper is employed to create interactive and responsive sliders or carousels for presenting content.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Install project dependencies using npm or Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```
2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
   This will start the development server using Vite, which offers fast development builds and hot module replacement.

3. Access the development server in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`

### Development Guidelines
- Ensure that Bootstrap classes and components are used consistently to maintain a cohesive UI design.

- Utilize Redux Toolkit for managing application state, including async actions for server interactions. Organize your Redux store, reducers, and actions effectively.

- Leverage React Router DOM for smooth navigation and route management.

- Take advantage of Swiper to create interactive and engaging sliders or carousels.
